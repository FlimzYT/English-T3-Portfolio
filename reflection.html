                <p class="reflection-p">Term 3 was a very eventful term because everything happend in a short amount of time. We did out CAT 1 exam and the projects back to back because of the short amount of time in between and some extra projects in between. Regarding the lessons we took this term, I feel like the lessons we took where much more important than the lessons we took last term although it might have been because I forgot what we took last term. We had alot of writing and multiple genres which was fun and challenging but very useful.</p>
